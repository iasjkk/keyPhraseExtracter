CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

The  Garment  Industry  of  India  is  an  Rs  one  trillion  industry.  Almost 
 33  %  of  its
knitwear  production  and  about  20%  of  its  woven-garment  production,  
both  by volume,  enters
export markets. Overall  about 25 % of the volume of its  garment production 
goes into export
markets, leaving 75 % for domestic consumption. The Industry covers over one 
Lakh units and
employs about 6 million workers, both directly and indirectly in almost equal 
proportion. The
indirect portion helps to sustain the direct production sector in the shape of 
items associated with
the garment industry production including sewing/embroidery thread, buttons, 
buckles, zippers,
metal plates, cardboard sheets, plastic butterflies and packaging material. 
Export of garments and
accessories from India are routed to all corners of the world. However, the 
USA, EU and Canada
together account for 70% of world exports. Markets in Asia, Africa, East 
Europe, Australia, New
Zealand and countries in the Pacific Ocean account for the rest.

The  fashion  industry  has  a  disastrous  impact  on  the  environment. In  
fact,  it  is  the
second largest polluter in the world, just after the oil industry. And the 
environmental damage is
increasing  as  the  industry  grows.  Some  of  the  facts  about  this  
industry  and  its  effect  on
environment are:

Figure 1 Impact Of Garment Industry On Environment

With the growing global concerns on sustainability issues such as scarcity of 
natural
resources, rapid environmental degradation, unequal balance of social equities 
and intense global
competitions,  sustainable  manufacturing  (SM)  strategies  have  drawn  
attention.  The concept  of
sustainability  has  considerably  influenced  the  nature  of  business  
activities.  As  human  beings


constantly pursuing higher life quality, manufacturing firms encounter a 
pressing challenge on
producing more products whilst using less resources as well as less pollution 
emitted and waste
generated [Smith L ,2012].

Sustainability  as  a  word  may  appear  to  be  simple,  but  in  reality  
have  many
mechanisms  that  affirm  the  necessity  to  build  safe,  healthy  and  
ethical  working  environment,
usage  of  recyclable  raw  materials  in  product  development,  following  
the  modern  methods  of
sustainable  production,  ensuring  fair  trade  and  to  avoid  using  harmful 
 chemicals  there  by
providing  due  compensation  to  the  society  for  having  utilized  the  
resources  provided  by  it
[Raghuram  Jayaraman,2002]  .Pursuing  more  environmentally  friendly  
products  and  business
operations,  and  being  socially  responsible  would  improve  operational  
efficiency  [Yang  MG,
2013] and generate competitive advantage [Yang CL, 2010].

The term ‘green industry’ comes from a concept ‘green economy, a pathway towards
sustainability  that  is  followed  by  organizations  such  as  the  World  
Bank  and  United  Nations
Environment  Programme  (UNEP)  (Barbier,2012).  Green  industry  has  been  
defined  by  United
Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) as “A pathway of 
sustainable growth by
undertaking green public investments and implementing public policy initiatives 
that encourage
environmentally responsible private investments.” (UNIDO, 2011).

As  this  is  more  focused  on  garment  industry  thus,  Green  Garment  
Factory  is
defined by sustainable manufacturing of garments. It is a system that 
integrates green buildings
and green production practices (clean production), CSR activities, as well as 
social and economic
benefits [Arindam Bhattacharya, R. J,2010].It reduces the consumption of 
natural resources and
the  environmental  impact  of  factory  buildings  during  construction,  
operations,  as  well  as  all
stages within their product lifecycle, creating eco-friendly industries and 
products to achieve the
goal of creating low-carbon emission and low-energy usage industries.

The green factory concept is divided into two components namely green building 
and
clean production.

Green Factory

Green Building                                                                  
              Clean Production


Green  building  is  the  practice  of  creating  structures  and  using  
processes  that  are
environmentally responsible and resource efficient throughout a building's 
life-cycle from sitting
to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and 
deconstruction. Green building
primarily focuses on reducing the overall impact of the built environment on 
human health and
the natural environment [Barrie, L.,2009].

And clean production according to UNEP, is defined as “The continuous 
application
of an integrated environmental strategy to processes, products, and services to 
increase efficiency
and reduce risks to human and the environment” [Barshilia, K. ,2014]

In  this  research,  the  plan  is  to  gain  a  detailed  knowledge  about  
the  certifications
provided  for  green  building  and  to  study  about  the  current  
sustainable  practices  in  garment
industries. The benefits gained from the practices will be analyzed and rated 
based on the results
and   the  investment  intended.  The  profit  gained  out  of  each  practice  
will  be  studied.  A
comparative  study  will  be  done  and  new  standards  will  be  developed,  
which   could  be
implemented with minimum cost.


CHAPTER 2
REVIEW OF LITERATURE

Alavy Kifait Reza, Md. Shahidul Islam, Afroza Ahammed Shimu (2017) in “Green
Industry  in  Bangladesh:  An  Overview”  presents  an  overview  of  the  
current  scenario  of  the
initiatives taken for a green industry and tries to examine the social economic 
and environment
benefit.  This  paper  also  discusses  major  prerequisites  of  green  
buildings  as  location  and
transportation,   sustainable   sites,   water   efficiency,   energy   and   
atmosphere,   materials   and
resources, indoor environmental quality, innovation, regional priority.

They have defined the terms like green industry and its benefits, and also 
discussed
about the LEED certification and the benefits of a green industry in a 
worldwide context before
focusing on a Bangladeshi perspective.

The  consensus  is  that  the  Bangladeshi  green  industry  framework  is  
adopted  from
principles  of  green  building  due  to  the  incentives  that  are  in  place 
 by  Bangladesh  Bank.  The
green  building  principles  that  are  widely  accepted  in  this  region  are 
 mainly  the   LEED
certification by USGBC, and the factors that grant this certification mainly 
dictate the terms of
the  current  green  industry.  It  should  be  noted  that  these  incentives  
are  not  Green  industry
increases  material  and  energy  efficiency  as  well  reduces  waste  outputs 
 and  pollution.  At  the
same time, it improves energy and water efficiency systems and develops a 
recycling process to
reduce  pollution  of  air,  land  and  water.  It  also  reduces  the  carbon  
emissions,  uses  renewable
energy in the production process and ensures that the final products are 
environmentally friendly.
This increases the productivity of workers by providing a healthy place for the 
workers.

This  study  reflects  on  the  need  for  a  unified  code  for  national  
requirements  for  a
green industry.

John W  K  Leung,  Spencer  Sze,  William  Yu  in  “A  Study  on  Green  
Manufacturing
Operations  Practices  in  China”  have  studied  how  manufacturers  are  
facing  the  challenge  of
balancing  the  environment  cost,  social  cost  and  production  cost  with  
the  advent  of  global
sustainability trends. This paper investigates the green manufacturing 
operation initiatives of four
reputable  manufacturers  to  gain  insights  into  how  to  maintain  the  
intricate  balance  between
profit,  social  cost  and  environment  cost  in  the  garment  industry  in  
China.  The  strategies  and
practices in achieving green manufacturing operation are identified and 
analyzed. It is envisioned
that the strategies and practices identified can be adapted in other industries 
and can serve as a
guideline for other green manufacturing operations to benchmark their green 
practices.

It  is  most  important  for  the  China’s  garment  industry to  understand  
its  role  in  the
world, being the largest apparel exporter in the world, and to realize also its 
impetus for future
development. A simple carbon footprint calculation could help in major energy 
saving and hence
a  reduction  in  production  cost.  On  the  other  hand,  environmental  
issues  may  originate  from
different sources. As a result, manufacturing processes potentially could lead 
to an initial cost


and process reengineering. Therefore, research of this kind is vital to the 
healthy growth of the
garment industry in China.

Nasif   Chowdhury   and   Jarin   Yasmin(2018)   in   “   A   Study   On   
Sustainable
Manufacturing Practices In RMG Industries Of Bangladesh” have discussed about 
sustainable
manufacturing and  have  divided  their  study into  two  part:  focus  on  
sustainable  manufacturing
and  common  sustainable  practices  of  ready-made  clothes  industry in  
which  the  commonplace
practices  is  shown  on  waste  management  practices,  sustainable  
production  technique  and
sustainable  materials  procurements  practices  the  various  geared  
up-garments  producers.  The
findings  indicate  that  numerous  companies  have  taken  initiative  to  run 
 their  manufacturing
system on sustainable manners and take numerous global certificates after 
satisfying sustainable
practice standards.

This  paper  also  discusses  elaborately  approximately  the  modern  state  
of  affairs  of
sustainable manufacturing practices in  the RMG  enterprise in  Bangladesh. The 
have a look at
goals  to  discover  what  the  common  sustainable  are  manufacturing  
practices  among  such
businesses and to what volume aware efforts are made to enrich such measures. 
For this reason,
the paper additionally discusses the key troubles of sustainable production, 
what are the level of
awareness of sustainability and initiatives taken  with the aid of 
manufacturers to make certain
sustainable manufacturing.

Pavan  Godiawala,  Noopur  Anand,  Jayantilal  Mathurbhai  Patel  (2014)  in  
“sky-
lighting-A  solution  to  reducing  energy  consumption  in  Apparel  Sector”  
have  discussed  all
aspects  of  day  light  harvesting.  Abundant,  eco-friendly,  continuous  and 
 free,  source  of  day
lighting has a potential to reduce the consumption of 20% of lighting load of a 
garment factory.
Apart from obvious advantage of energy conservation, harvesting of sunlight has 
many industrial
advantages as well as positive impact on psychological and physiological health 
of workers in
apparel sector.

Implementing   daylight   harvesting   solution   has   many   challenges   
starting   from
consistency of the sunlight throughout the day& round the year, penetration of 
light in vertical
structure &deep regions, apart from commonly known issues of glare and 
radiation.

This paper also includes case study on Brandix factory, German Bayer factory and
Helsingborg  Hospital.  in  the  end  it  was  concluded  that  Various  models 
 of  skylight  harvesting
have been demonstrated successfully for industrial lighting and thus the usage 
of artificial lights
has been reduced substantially. These works are based on specific models and 
find limited usage,
due   to   geographical   variations   and   limited   reproducibility.   
Concurrently   challenge   of
transmitting the daylight into deeper interiors should be met by bending and 
transmitting light to
longer distance.


Raghuram    Jayaraman,    Amit    Kumar    Anjanee    in    “Intellectual    
Capital    on
Sustainability   for   Garment   Industry:   Implications   and   Challenges”   
have   discussed   about
sustainable  business  and  has  defined  it  as  an  organization  that  has  
no  negative  impact  on  the
environment or economy through its processes, products and manufacturing 
activities that meets
the  current  demands  with  due  concern  to  resource  availability  for  
future  the  generations  by
utilizing renewable resources.

This  paper  also  focuses  on  the  importance  of  building  Intellectual  
Capital  and
Knowledge  Management  on  Sustainable  practices  to  annihilate  challenges  
that  contribute  to
carbon   footprint   via   Manufacturing   Infrastructure,   Raw   materials   
utilized,   Supply  Chain,
Business Processes, etc.   Intellectual Capital involves a company’s employee 
expertise, unique
organizational systems  and intellectual property.  Building  Intellectual 
Capital on sustainability
focuses  on  the  creation  of  Knowledge  assets  pertaining  to  sustainable  
practices  in  Design,
Product Development, Raw materials, Supply Chain and Production Practices.

The conclusion of the paper was that the Public concern about climate change and
Global warming has also increased considerably which has led to the emergence 
of sustainable
business practices at all stages of garment manufacturing. Brands, Buyers and 
Buying houses are
looking  forward  to  promote  biodegradable  and  sustainable  garments  as  
an  effective  way  of
reducing the impact textiles and apparel manufacturing sectors on the 
environment.

Sharmishtha  Dash,  Shalu  Kumari,  Jonalee  Das  Bajpai(2018)  in  “Barriers  
and
Challenges  for  Green  Garment  Factory:  India  “have  discussed  about  
Sustainability,  Green
building, Clean Production, LEED, GRIHA, Green Garment Factory & its Barriers.”

Terms  like  sustainable  manufacturing,  green  garment  factory,  green  
building,  and
clean production were defined in the paper. A benefit of green garment factory 
was mentioned in
terms  of  environmental  benefits,  economical  benefits  and  social  
benefits.  The  paper  has  also
categorized the barrier & challenges faced in India into internal barrier and 
external barrier.

Some of the internal barrier was financial, people, organizational, etc. And 
external
barriers  depend  on  policy  framework,  market,  supply  chain,  etc.  The  
internal  barriers  mostly
relate  to  lack  of  awareness,  skill  sets,  strategies,  financial  budget  
and  lack  of  commitment  by
Organization.  Whereas  the  external  barriers  are  more  to  do  with  
Policies,  Market  condition,
Supply Chain and the Traditions.


CHAPTER 3
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

3.1 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM

Garment  industry  is  the  second  most  polluting  industry  in  our  planet  
and  20%  of
global  carbon-di-oxide  is  produced  by  them.  The  current  and  future  
generation  will  suffer
heavily  because  of  this.  So  this  is  the  high  time  to  look  and  
control  it  as  much  as  possible.
Maximum industries are not willing to follow sustainable practices because they 
are not thinking
about  long  term  effects  and  they  think  it  requires  high  investment.  
So  they  hesitate  to  spend
money for it.

The  other  reason  for  not  implementing  sustainable  practices  is  lack  
of  technical
experts.  Thus  our  aim  is  to  develop  standards  for  the  garments  
industry  following  best
sustainable  practices  with  minimum  cost,  so  that  maximum  number  of  
garments  industry  can
follow this.

3.2 OBJECTIVE

•    To study different certification, procedures and the current sustainable 
practices.

•    To suggest practices those are cheap and easy to follow.

3.3 RESEARCH DESIGN

The study of different certifications and procedures is a descriptive research 
design.

And the second objective is exploratory research where different practices will 
be explored.

3.4 DATA COLLECTION

3.4.1 Secondary data

The secondary data used in this study is mainly collected through articles, 
company’s
reports, journals, research papers, etc.

The  data  collected  using  these  are  the  certifications,  procedures  and  
different
sustainable practices used by the garment industries.


3.4.2 Primary data

The primary data is collected using structured questionnaire which was 
administered
personally with the executives for conceptual clarity.

3.4.2.1 Population

Population for the questionnaire is generally kept low as authenticity is more. 
For the
research, garment manufacturing units in and around Bangalore was chosen.

3.4.2.2 Sample unit

The  data  collected  is  only  from  the  garment  manufacturing  industries  
present  in
Bangalore. The respondents are mostly the executives that are currently working 
in the company
for more than a period of 2 years.

3.4.2.3 Sampling techniques

The   technique   used   for   collecting   the   data   is   judgmental   
sampling because
participants are selected based on availability and willingness to take part. 
It is a non probability
sampling method.

3.4.2.4 Sample size

The sample size for the present study is 10 garment manufacturing industries 
that are
in Bangalore.

3.4.2.5 Method of collection

The data collection method used for the study is an interview with the 
executives of
different garment industry.

3.4.2.6 Tool of data

The  data  collection  tool  used  is  a  questionnaire  designed  for  the  
executives  to
conduct the study.

3.5 DATA ANALYSIS

•    The data analysis is done using pie charts.

•    Some of the answers can be descriptive too.


3.6 SCOPE OF RESEARCH

•    The  research  done  for  the  current  topic  is  limited  to  Bangalore  
only  because  of
geographical constraints.

•    The  research  only  includes  garment  industries.  Further  this  
research  can  be  done  for
textile and other textile auxiliary industries.

•    The research can be conducted all across India covering as much industries 
as possible.

•    The scope can also include industries that support garment industries like 
washing units,
printing units, accessory manufacturing units.

3.7 LIMITATIONS

•    The   research   is   limited   to   the   industries   present   in   
Bangalore   only   because   of
geographical constraints, time constraints and other constraints.

•    Any textile industry is hardly present in Bangalore hence the scope only 
covers garment
industries.

•    The research does not include auxiliary industries due to time 
constraints.

•    As the method used for data collection is a schedule one, hence covering 
all the industries
small or big was a huge challenge due to limited time available.


CHAPTER 4
DATA ANALYSIS

4.1 SECONDARY DATA

4.1.1 DIFFERENT CERTIFICATIONS ON SUSTAINABILITY

4.1.1.1 ENERGY STAR for Buildings Program

ENERY  STAR  was  originally  developed  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  
Protection
Agency (EPA) as a voluntary labeling program to promote energy-efficient 
products and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.

In  the  late  1990s,  EPA  partnered  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  
(DOE)  to
increase  the  scope  of  the  ENERGY  STAR  program  by  launching  a  whole  
building  program,
ENERGY STAR for Buildings.

•    ENERGY STAR Tools

ENERGY   STAR   for   Buildings   includes   specifications   for   Existing   
Buildings,
Commercial New Construction, Industrial Energy Management, and ENERGY STAR for 
Small
Business.  The program includes three tools for assisting and encouraging 
organizations in their
efforts to reduce energy use and limit resulting greenhouse gas emissions.

•    ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager

This software tool allows organizations to measure, track, and compare their 
energy
use to other buildings.  It is the backbone of the ENERGY STAR for Buildings 
program and a
key  verification  component  of  the  LEED  for  Existing  Buildings:  
Operations  &  Maintenance
rating system.

•    ENERGY STAR Task Manager

This no-cost online tool allows architects and building owners to set energy 
targets
and  receive  an  ENERGY  STAR  energy  performance  score  for  projects  
during  the  design
process.

•    ENERGY STAR Energy Performance Scale


A  score  between  1  and  100  indicates  building  performance  relative  to  
similar
buildings nationwide.

•    ENERGY STAR Buildings Label

Buildings  with  an  energy  performance  scale  score  of  75  or  higher  
achieve  the
ENERGY STAR label, indicating that they perform in the top 25% of their 
building type.

4.1.1.2 LEED

LEED –  or  Leadership  in  Energy  &  Environmental  Design  –  is  an  
internationally
recognized    green    building    certification    system    and    standard.  
  It    delivers third-party
verification that a space was designed and built using best-in-class strategies 
to address its entire
life cycle.

Developed  by  the  U.S.  Green  Building  Council  (USGBC),  of  which  GBA  
is  a
chapter, LEED provides building owners and operators with a concise framework 
for identifying
and implementing practical and measurable green building design, construction, 
operations, and
maintenance solutions.  LEED can be applied to all building types.

LEED  can  be  referred  to  in  two  different  ways:   as  it  relates  to 
buildings and  as  it
relates to people.  Buildings can be LEED-certified and people can be 
LEED-accredited.

When  a  building  is  LEED-certified,  it  has  achieved  a  certain  number  
of  points  or
credits in a particular rating system.

Levels of the certification are:

Figure 4.1.1.2  Levels Of LEED Certification


4.1.1.3 Net Zero Energy Building

The  International  Living  Future  Institute  (ILFI)  provides  a  
certification  option  for
a Net   Zero   Energy   Building   (NZEB) under   its   umbrella   of   the   
holistic Living   Building
Challenge (LBC) certification.

Such  buildings  have  100%  of  their  energy  needs  supplied  by  on-site  
renewable
energy on a net annual basis. The NZEB designation verifies that a building is 
truly operating as
claimed, harnessing energy from the sun, wind, or earth to exceed net annual 
demand.

According to the ILFI website, nearly any building can become NZEB-certified: 
new
or operational, anywhere in the world.

4.1.1.4 Sustainable Textile Production (STeP) by OEKO-TEX:

STeP  certification  is  given  to  companies  to  show  that  they promote  
good  working
conditions,  environmental  protection  and  safety  during  fibre  production, 
 spinning,  weaving,
knitting,  treatment  and  finishing.  The  certification  ensures  adherence  
in  the  following  areas:
Health  and  safety  of  workers,  Proper  use  and  handling  of  chemicals,  
Quality  management,
Environmental impact of production and waste disposal.

The  certificate,  which  is  renewable  every  3  years,  is  issued  after  
an  audit  of
production facilities by an official from OEKO-TEX®. Even after certification, 
OEKO-TEX®
will still carry random audits to ensure that the certified company is still in 
compliance with the
terms of the certification. A key advantage of STeP is that it connects 
suppliers to brands and
retailers looking for textiles and textile products that are produced 
ethically.

4.1.1.5 Eco-label Certification Such As STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX:

There are several eco-labels but among the most globally recognized 
certifications in
this  category  is  the  Standard  100  by  OEKO-TEX.  The  Standard  100  by  
OEKO-TEX  is
concerned with consumer safety by ensuring that health standards are upheld 
during production.
Textile and garment safety is guaranteed by testing of raw yarn, finished 
textiles, garments and
accessories used on garments, such as buttons and zippers.


Standard 100 certification tries to limit the occurrence of banned substances 
such as
Azo dyes, heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and nickel, and other harmful 
substances such as
formaldehyde  and  pentachlorophenol  in  raw  fiber,  semi-finished  yarn  and 
 finished  textiles  or
ready to wear garments. Even after certification, control checks of products 
already in the market
are carried out to make sure the manufacturer is compliant.

4.1.1.6 Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)

GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) is a certificate that sets global 
standards for
natural  fibers  to  ensure  that  yarn,  fabrics  and  apparel  that  are  
considered  ‘organic’  retain  this
authenticity  from  harvesting,  processing,  exportation  and  selling.  The  
certificate  is  issued
collaboratively by trade bodies and textile associations from countries like 
Japan and the USA in
an     effort     to     increase     transparency     in     certification     
organic     textiles     globally.
GOTS  certificate  is  issued  after  wastewater  from  processing  sites  is  
tested  for  chemical
substances such as fungicides, formaldehyde, ammonia, complexing chemicals, 
solvents, heavy
metals and chlorophenols among others. Though natural fibres may start off as 
organic, treating
them with any of these chemicals means they are no longer 100% organic.

GOTS also imposes social responsibility requirements to ensure that workers are 
not
subjected to forced labour, denied fair wages, held against their will or 
exposed to unhygienic
and unsafe work conditions.

4.1.1.7 NSF/ANSI 336 certification

This  certification  assures  end  users  that  social  and  environmental  
standards  are
maintained during production of textile products meant for commercial use, such 
as during the
production of fabrics used for beddings, draperies and upholstery in hotels, 
offices or hospitals.

Pre-certificate evaluation is done based on how the fibers were sourced, if the 
fabric
is safe and if manufacture took into account energy and water conservation, 
social responsibility,
recycling, among others.


4.1.1.8 Global Recycle Standard

This certificate ensures transparency the amount of recycled material used to 
make
end  products.  Bronze  certification  means  clothing  contains  less  than  
30%  recycled  material,
silver contains 70% to 95% recycled material, while gold certification is 
issued for products that
are 95% to 100% recycled.

4.1.2  SIMPLE STEPS TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY

•    Water  aerators  are  a  one-stop  solution  to  the  problem  of  running 
 taps.  Aerators,  once
fitted inside a valve, can save nearly 35-40 per cent of water per minute when 
compared
to regular taps.

Figure 4.1.9  Water Aerators

•    Replace incandescent bulbs with CFL and LED fixtures. CFL use 25-35% of 
the energy
used by incandescent bulbs and LED use more than 75% less energy and last 25 
times
longer than incandescent lighting.

•    The leftover food can be sold to near by farmers to turn it into manure by 
composting or
the industry itself can do it.

•    The industry can motivate workers to switch off their machines every time 
they leave it
thus this small step can save a lot of energy.

•    The toilet flush installed can have two buttons where the small button can 
be used when
much water is not required and the other button can be used when heavy flow of 
water is
required.

•    The industry can use briquettes instead of wood or coal for their boilers. 
They are slow
burning, more efficient and are cheap too.

•    As the garment manufacturing industry uses a lot of different types of 
machinery hence a
proper maintenance of those will reduce its power consumption and will last 
long.


4.2 PRIMARY DATA ANALYSIS

Primary data is taken in the form of questionnaire in various garment 
manufacturing
industries.  Primary  data  has  been  collected  in  10  garment  industries  
which  are  in  Bangalore.
Based  on  no  of  operators  present  in  the  industry data  primary data  is 
 divided  in  3  categories.
These are:

•    Large scale garment manufacturing industry: Having more than 1500 
operators

•    Medium scale garment manufacturing industry: Having 800-1500 operators

•    Small scale garment manufacturing industry: Having below 800 operators

4.2.1 LARGE SCALE GARMENT MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY DATA ANALYSIS

Large scale garments industries are those that deals with export orders. So 
generally
they are trying to improve themselves by comparing themselves to other 
companies and they try
to incorporate the best practices including sustainability.

For the large scale industries, the profit margins is also high so they have 
more scope
of  improving  the  company  in  terms  of  sustainability.  For  primary  data 
 analysis  a  total  5
renowned companies were visited which are manufacturing garments on a large 
scale.

•    Approximate   annual   budget   for   sustainability:   For   large   
scale   company   60%
companies annual budget is more than 10 lacs and for 40% company it is in 
between 5-

CHAPTER 5
DATA FINDINGS

•    For large scale company 60% companies annual budget is more than 10 lacs 
and for 40%
company  it  is  in  between  5-  10  lacs.  So  in  Bangalore  the  large  
scale  garments
manufacturing companies are somewhat aware about sustainability.

•    For large scale garment manufacturing companies, 2 companies are in 
process of getting
the certification and 1 company already has the certificate and 2 of them are 
not having
any certificate in terms of sustainability.

•    60%  company  are  aware  about  the  sustainability  so  they  are  also  
motivating  their
operator to become sustainable in a large scale garment manufacturing 
industries.

•    The large scale industries are mostly having budget in between 5 – 10 lacs 
or more. The
medium  scale  are  having  a  budget  in  between  1  –  5  lacs  and  the  
small  scale  are  not
spending more than a lac on sustainable practices.

•    Only large scale garment manufacturing industries are having any 
certifications in terms
of sustainability.

•    Almost all the industries are aware of the importance of sustainability 
hence all  except
one are planning on being more sustainable in coming years.

•    Most of the decisions taken in terms of sustainability are carried out by 
plant head or IE
head. They don’t have any separate team to look after that.


CHAPTER 6
SUGGESTIONS

•    Small scale garment manufacturing industries can try to be more 
sustainable by following
simple steps like making their operators aware of importance of saving 
electricity, water,
etc.

•    All  the  industries  mostly  small  scale  one  can  plan  a  sustainable 
 week  to  make  their
operators more environmental friendly.

•    The government can implement a  rule where it  will be compulsory to hold 
atleast one
certification in terms of sustainability for garment manufacturing industries 
because only
large scale industries are only the ones to have it.


CHAPTER 7
CONCLUSION

Different certifications, and process that are related to sustainability were 
studied in detail. There
are many certifications that industries can follow. The small steps that are 
discussed does not
require big investments but can be very effective if sincerely followed.

The questionnaire done to find out the how many of the industries are aware of 
sustainability
concluded that still many industries are lagging behind when it comes to being 
environmental
friendly. The questionnaire helped us to figure out where the garment 
industries are lagging
behind. But since this was restricted to Bangalore only, drawing conclusion for 
the whole
garment industry would be unfair.
