INTRODUCTION

The  Garment  Industry  of  India  is  an  Rs  one  trillion  industry.  Almost 
 33  %  of  its
knitwear  production  and  about  20%  of  its  woven-garment  production,  
both  by volume,  enters
export markets. Overall  about 25 % of the volume of its  garment production 
goes into export
markets, leaving 75 % for domestic consumption. The Industry covers over one 
Lakh units and
employs about 6 million workers, both directly and indirectly in almost equal 
proportion. The
indirect portion helps to sustain the direct production sector in the shape of 
items associated with
the garment industry production including sewing/embroidery thread, buttons, 
buckles, zippers,
metal plates, cardboard sheets, plastic butterflies and packaging material. 
Export of garments and
accessories from India are routed to all corners of the world. However, the 
USA, EU and Canada
together account for 70% of world exports. Markets in Asia, Africa, East 
Europe, Australia, New
Zealand and countries in the Pacific Ocean account for the rest.

The  fashion  industry  has  a  disastrous  impact  on  the  environment. In  
fact,  it  is  the
second largest polluter in the world, just after the oil industry. And the 
environmental damage is
increasing  as  the  industry  grows.  Some  of  the  facts  about  this  
industry  and  its  effect  on
environment are:

With the growing global concerns on sustainability issues such as scarcity of 
natural
resources, rapid environmental degradation, unequal balance of social equities 
and intense global
competitions,  sustainable  manufacturing  (SM)  strategies  have  drawn  
attention.  The concept  of
sustainability  has  considerably  influenced  the  nature  of  business  
activities.  As  human  beings
